This is the primary codebase that powered the online community [uniqna.com](https://www.uniqna.com). The codebase's engine is  built upon the Django Framework.

## A TL;DR of our current live stack:
1. Engine - Python v3.5 | Django v2
2. Database - PostgreSQL
3. Frontend - Bulma, Vue and few other magic
4. Cloud - Ubuntu 18.04 and nginx

## About
The initial commits of uniqna began as a test project on which I ([Jeremy](https://github.com/jeremyphilemon)) would tinker around with Django and experiment with its MVC Architecture. In fact, the very idea of building an online forum didn't cross my mind then.

After developing the authentication system, I started working on a tiny Q&A module where users could post questions and contribute to answers. Furthermore, the front page was developed to list all the questions and sort them according to their popularity. It was fun learning how to connect the dots between the database, the templates and the python engine.

When the website was quite stable and worked seamlessly (just kidding), I was struck by an epiphany that this could actually be used by real users. I met along with my fellow good developer friend [Sriram](https://github.com/digi0ps) and discussed about the type of users who would want to use this platform and how we could work as a team for further development of the codebase.

So we put on our magical hats and, fast forward through all the slack discussions, all nighters, merge conflicts and intensive coding sessions, together we developed a working online platform called uniqna.

## Contribution Guidelines
This project has now stopped active development, however, you can open up issues or pull requests and have fun!

If you're new to contributing to Open Source on Github, [this guide](https://guides.github.com/activities/contributing-to-open-source/) can help you get started. Contributing to Open Source can seem very indimidating at first, but I promise it'll be fun :)
